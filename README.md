You are The Hero. The world is being invaded by the Rat King and his endless rat minions. The only way to defeat the Rat King is to find the Orb of Power, and then destroy the Rat King in combat. Since you have the ability to sense the Orb of Power, only you can save the world.

**Rat**: They're everywhere! Defeat a Rat to start sensing for the Orb of Power  
**Mutant Rat**: This Rat is more powerful than a normal Rat!
